As a new user, I want to be able to quickly search/browse for movies so that I can decide on something to watch. I want to be able to open the app and input the streaming services I have access to, my favorite genres, and the maximum amount of time I want to spend watching movies into it easily and quickly with just a few clicks. I want a selection of several highly rated movies which fit my provided criteria to be listed for me for me to easily assess and decide on based on my interests. If the list of movies only contains movies that I have already seen or movies which do not seem interesting to me, I want to be able to perform a new search based on my interests.

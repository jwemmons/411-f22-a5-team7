As a logged-in, returning user, I don’t have time right now, but I want to plan for the weekend. I might want to make a playlist of movies that I want to watch for later and mark it as watched. I want to be able to use my saved preferred streaming services and other saved preferences to do a quick search, while also having the ability to do a more advanced manual search. I then want to be able to save the movies I’m interested in to a playlist. I should have the ability to create multiple playlists and name them myself. In a specific playlist I should be able to mark a movie as watched or not watched. When adding a movie to a playlist it should automatically be marked as not watched. On returning, I should find all my playlists in one place and have the ability to search through them to find a specific playlist. Additionally, I should be able to rename or delete a playlist. Furthermore, I should be able to share the playlist with friends through a link and also make the playlist public for other users of the application to look at.

As a logged-in, returning user, I don’t have time right now, but I want to plan for the weekend. I might want to make a playlist of "liked" movies that I want to watch for later and mark it as watched. I want to be able to use my saved preferred streaming services and other saved preferences to do a quick search, while also having the ability to do a more advanced manual search. I then want to be able to save the movies I’m interested in to a playlist. In a specific playlist I should be able to mark a movie as "liked" or "not liked". On returning, I should find all my liked movies in one place.

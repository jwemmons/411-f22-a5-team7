As a logged-in, returning user, I just finished watching a movie, and I want to go back and find other movies like that, as well as be able to see the results of my previous searches. I want there to be a section somewhere in the app where I can see each of my previous movie searches listed, with movies returned with each search included. That way, I can find the search where I got the movie I just watched, and see which other movies were recommended in that search. I would also like to be able to compute a new search based on the movie I watched. I would like to be able to find that movie in my search history and then, from there, click a button labeled something like “Search based on this movie”, that would then search for other movies similar to that one.

As a logged-in, returning user, I want to save/store my user preferences for streaming service platforms, genres, movie length, and change them anytime, so that I can watch a movie fast without doing any work. I want to be logged in as a guestâ€™s preferences will not be saved. When signed in, I want to be able to click on my profile and set my preferences, so that all parameters will be filled out when I go to generate the list of movies. I want to be able to change these preferences at any time. I want to be able to switch between different user profiles with different sets of saved preferences, so that I can browse through movies depending on the mood or occasion.

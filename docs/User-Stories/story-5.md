As a new user, I heard a lot about the service. I want to create an account. However, I donâ€™t want to make an actual account and go through the hassle because I will probably forget my account info in the future. I would prefer to log in through something like facebook or google while still maintaining full functionality of a normal user. If I were to come back and log in through the same method of google or facebook, I want them to remember my user settings and such. I may want to sign up for updates or notifications through facebook or google, but I should have the option instead of it being automatically set for me.

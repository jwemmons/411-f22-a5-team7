As a new user, I heard a lot about the service. I want to create an account. However, I donâ€™t want to make an actual account and go through the hassle because I will probably forget my account info in the future. I would prefer to log in through something like Spotify while still maintaining full functionality of a normal user. If I were to come back and log in through the same method, I want them to remember my user settings and such.
